## About
This project was undertaken as part of the Women Who Code Days of Kaggle Challenge, where participants were tasked with selecting a dataset categorized as beginner, intermediate, or advanced. I opted for an intermediate dataset sourced from Kaggle.

Throughout this project, my focus centered on tasks such as filling in missing values using countryinfo module, cleaning the data, and conducting data analysis through visualization. The visualizations highlight countries with the highest and lowest values in categories such as CO2 emissions, birth rate, fertility rate, GDP, and more.

To gain insights into correlations between features, heatmap and pair plots were generated, revealing both the distribution and linear relationships within the dataset.

Following the visualization phase, I implemented scaling using the MinMax Scaler from scikit-learn and performed normalization.
